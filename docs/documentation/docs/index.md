This repository provides developers with a set of reusable property pane controls that can be used in their SharePoint Framework (SPFx) solutions.

> **Important**: The controls project has a minimal dependency on SharePoint Framework version `1.3.0`. Be aware that the controls might not work in solutions your building for on-premises. As for on-premises solutions version `1.1.0` will get used.

## Getting started

Enter the following command to install the dependency to your project:

```
npm install @pnp/spfx-property-controls --save --save-exact

### Configuration
